# Bookmark CRUD System

A simple project that demonstrates the concept of a **CRUD system** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using:

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 + Bootstrap**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **LocalStorage** for storing data in the browser

---

## 📌 Project Idea
The project is a basic **Bookmark Manager** where the user can:

- Add a new bookmark (site name, site URL, user email, and password).
- Display all bookmarks in a table.
- Edit an existing bookmark.
- Delete a single bookmark or remove all at once.
- Search bookmarks by site name.
- Input validation:
  - Site name must start with a capital letter and be at least 3 characters long.
  - Email must follow the correct format.
  - Password must be strong (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character).
